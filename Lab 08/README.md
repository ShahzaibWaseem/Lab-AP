# Lab 08: Hibernate

## Task
- SEECS contracted an organization to automate his fee slip services for student. In this regard, SEECS recommended that the Fee Slip must have first name, second name, registration number, student password, fee-month and current date. Being a Computer Scientist / Software Engineer, design an application which uses hibernate, loads hibernate-mapping, configuration files, and interacts with database to store, display, update and delete fee slips of students. Also do not save the password in the data base. Also keep all the columns as not Null.
