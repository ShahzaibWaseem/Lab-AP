# Assignment 02: Threads

## Tasks
- You need to develop application using threads in Java. Read a long file ( > 500,000 characters ASCII) and develop a frequency distribution of characters. You may use any design pattern if you feel comfortable.
- Compare your results when the same program is run without Threading. Show your results in a table clearly mentioning the running time.

## Results
I have used a text file of 1014978 ASCII Characters named “RandomStrings.txt”.
The Results I got were:
- Non Threaded: 1150 milliseconds
- Threaded: 24 milliseconds

## How to Run
To compile the files just type the command “javac FrequencyCount.java” and then to run the files type “java FrequencyCount”.
